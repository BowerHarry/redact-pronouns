# redact-pronouns
I wrote an EXPERIMENTAL program to redact pronouns from a book/chapter. 
Depending on writing style the program has varying success, it usually performs excellently over a chapter but poorly over a book. 

Line 198 requires a file path to the text.

Line 199 requires a file path to a comma seperated list of phrases that you also want to be redacted.

Line 200 requires a file path where the result can be outputted.
